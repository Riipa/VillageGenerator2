# VillageGenerator2 v0.1
Inspired by VillageGenerator by the brilliant MountainWizard. Aspiring to deliver on additional functionality and a clean sheet when it comes to data structure.

Current version alsways deployed to http://vg.matti.wtf/

Current version supports creating a village of random size (this will be tweaked) with a Majority Species and a Main Industry. Two currently nameless notable persons will be created.

ToDo List:

- Add tavern, travern menu and places of interest
- Add names
- Add ability to save and access later
- Add ability to add more notable persons
- General feature parity with VillageGenerator
- Many other things. :P
